Without understanding why and how things work, students are unable to judge the LLM’s output; even when they copy-paste the code and it works, they will not be able to solve a similar or related task next time.\n\nThis phenomenon - that LLMs are useful only if you already have a good idea what you need to do - is discussed very well by prof. Ethan Mallick HERE.",

This chapter covers the most common issues that I encounter.\n\n5.0.1 For Windows\n\n\n5.0.2 File Explorer, folders and file\n\nFile explorer allows you to see all the files saved to your computer stored in different sections like Downloads or Desktop. There is a search bar in the top right hand corner which allows you to search for a document or folder by name.\n\nA folder is shown by a folder icon next to the name of the folder, it also says File Folder under type.\n\nA file is shown by an icon of the File type and the name of the File. The type of file is also written under type - in this case a Microsoft Excel workbook titled Book1 and a Microsoft Word Document titled Essay plan\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Paths and hierarchies\n\nTo find your file you need to follow the path through the hierarchy. To start you need to know if your file is saved to your hard drive or One Drive. from there you can either click on the file or the folder it is saved in.\n\nThe box in the image above shows the path to the file, the video below shows how to get there\n\n\n\n5.0.4 One Drive vs hard drive\nOne Drive stores your files in the cloud allowing you to access them from anywhere by logging into your account. you will have a One drive account connected to your university email that will show when using the university computers, by saving your files here you can also work on them on personal devices. the Hard Drive is storage built into the computer your using, saving files here saves them to that device.\n\n\n5.0.5 How to unzip a file/folder\n\nTo make large files easier to transfer we can compress them (zip them). These files will need to be unzipped before you can use the content inside. this can be done 2 ways. the first way is by entering the zipped file and pressing the unzip button in the tip right corner. the next way is to right click on the zipped folder before entering it and clicking on unzip from the menu.\n\n\n\n5.0.6 How to move/copy files from one folder to another\n\n\n5.0.7 File extensions and default programes to open files\n\n\n5.0.8 Concepts of paths and hierarchies\n\n\n5.0.9 Folders and files, and how to use File Explorer or Finder\n\n\n5.0.10 File extensions and default programmes to open files\n\n\n5.0.11 How to move or copy files from one folder to another\n\n\n5.0.12 Difference between OneDrive and a hard drive\n\n\n5.0.13 How to unzip a file/folder",
