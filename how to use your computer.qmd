### Paths and hierarchies

-   To find your file you need to follow the path through the hierarchy. To start you need to know if your file is saved to your hard drive or One Drive. from there you can either click on the file or the folder it is saved in.

These files will need to be unzipped before you can use the content inside. this can be done 2 ways. the first way is by entering the zipped file and pressing the unzip button in the tip right corner. the next way is to right click on the zipped folder before entering it and clicking on unzip from the menu.
