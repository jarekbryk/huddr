# How to use a computer

In our experience, one of the biggest barriers to learning programming for students today is not the complexity of coding itself, but rather the lack of fundamental computer skills. Many students struggle with _operating_ a computer, which makes learning the hard stuff (data science and programming in R) even trickier. Here is a screenshot from a recent talk in which Jarek listed common issues:

From a teaching perspective, a very useful reading in this context is this 30 year-old text (!) by Phil Agre: [How to Help Someone Use a Computer](https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/). All of his recommendations are still valid today (! again).

## OneDrive vs hard drive

Microsoft's cloud storage system OneDrive is the default on all university computers. When you log in to your account on a university computer, your "home" folder is located on OneDrive. This has an important advantage: by saving your files there you will be able to access them from any computer that is connected to the internet. So you can continue working on the same files on your home computer after the class, and you don't have to copy files back and forth (or email them to yourself). Another advantage of this setup is backup: OneDrive files are backed up by Microsoft; but you should treat it only as secondary backup and protect your files independently (e.g. by coping them to another disk, or another cloud storage system).

["Hard drive"](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk) (a.k.a. Hard Drisk Drive, or HDD) is a physical data storage device in a computer. They were once semi-mechanical devices with small disks spinning at a very high speed, and data read off them using magnets. Now they are most often base on flash memory and have no moving parts: they are called "SSD" (["Solid State Drive"](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)) and you can find them in every kind of electronic device.

To be clear: computers in the classroom and computers that manage OneDrive system in the cloud all use some form of data storage (HDD and SDD). The difference between OneDrive and hard drive is only in the place where the main storage device is located.

## But what is "cloud" anyway?

"Cloud" is an unfortunate name, as nothing that it stands for is related to clouds (except maybe the general fuzziness of the term). By using the name "cloud" we simply mean that the data (files, folders etc.) that you see on a computer in front of you is not actually stored on that computer. Instead, it is regularly copied ("synced") to computers physically located elsewhere (often in massive data centres all around the world). 
Think about a Netflix film that you may be watching on your phone: the film is not stored on your phone's SSD  unless you had downloaded it. It is being streamed from a HDD or SSD no a computer "in the cloud" somewhere almost in real time.

## File Explorer, folders and files

File Explorer allows you to see all the files saved to your computer stored in different folders (also known as directories) like Downloads or Desktop, whether locally or in the cloud. There is a search bar in the top right hand corner which allows you to search for a document or folder by name.

A folder is shown by a folder icon next to the name of the folder, it also says File Folder under type.

A file is shown by an icon of the File type and the name of the File. The type of file is also written under type - in this case a Microsoft Excel workbook titled Book1 and a Microsoft Word Document titled Essay plan

## File extensions

Many operating systems use file extensions as indicators of what kind of file type a file is. For example, text files have an extension "txt", Excel files have an extension "xlsx", and so on. Operating systems will often make an educated guess about which programme opens which file, using the extension as a hint, so that "eml" files are opened by Outlook, for example (or another mail client).

There are two common problems with the file extension system: 1) MS Windows by default hides file extensions and 2) multiple programmes can use the same file type (also, this system can be hijacked for nefarious purposes). On some university computers, *.Rmd files that are used by R Studio to open R project folders are also used by Endnote (a reference manager), which takes a preference over R Studio. Endnote has no idea how to use R Studio's Rmd files, and it gets annoying very quickly as it tries to open these files - unsuccessfully.

### Paths and hierarchies

To know where your file is in the computer (regardless of whether it is local or in the cloud), operating systems use _paths_ that indicate location of files in a (mostly) hierarchical way. To start you need to know if your file is saved to your hard drive or One Drive. from there you can either click on the file or the folder it is saved in.

The box in the image above shows the path to the file, the video below shows how to get there


### How to unzip a file/folder

To make large files easier to transfer (and save storage space) we can compress them (or "zip" them, so called after one of [the most common file formats that support data compression/uncompression](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)). These files will need to be uncompressed unzipped before you can use the content inside. this can be done 2 ways. the first way is by entering the zipped file and pressing the unzip button in the tip right corner. the next way is to right click on the zipped folder before entering it and clicking on unzip from the menu.
