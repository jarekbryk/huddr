# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is an online book created to facilitate learning R by students at the University of Huddersfield's Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences. However, unlike other books with tutorials on R, this book is thought of as a quick reference, with lists of core functions, their parameters and code syntax all in one place. We hope that it will help students learning R to overcome the challenges of figuring out how to analyse the data and how to translate this plan into code.
