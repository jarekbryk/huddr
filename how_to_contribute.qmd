# Improving this book

This book is open source. It is published under a [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) so you may use its contents however you like (we would appreciate if you [let us know if you do](mailto:j.bryk@hud.ac.uk))!). It also means anyone can suggest improvements or fix mistakes.

We would be very happy if you let us know about errors that that you spotted, or if you have suggestions to improve or expand the book. You do not need to be an expert in programming to contribute and you cannot break the book by doing so — even spotting a missing word or pointing out a confusing explanation will be helpful to us!

There are two main ways to contribute:

## Openning an issue

This is like leaving a note online. For example: _There’s a typo in Part 2, Chapter 3_ or _I found the explanation of loops unclear_. Issues are the simplest way to give us feedback and [they can be opened here](https://github.com/jarekbryk/huddr/issues) by clicking the green button "New issue" on the right.

## Submitting a pull request (PR)

This is a way to propose an actual edit of any piece of content in the book (for example, fixing the typo directly, rephrasing a paragraph, etc.). This requires a few extra steps but can all be accomplished in the browser and we can then apply the fix more easily). The steps to submit your proposed changes to be consider by the book's editor (i.e. Jarek) are as follows:

1. Go to the page for this book’s files: [https://github.com/jarekbryk/huddr](https://github.com/jarekbryk/huddr) or click the "edit this page" button at the bottom of each page.
2. Find the file that you want to modify (for example, a `basic_functions.qmd` file) and click it.
3. On the file page, click the pencil icon to edit the file in the browser.
4. Make your change in the editor (fix the text, add a link, etc.).
5. Scroll down to “Propose changes” and write a short message like “Fix typo in the filter function”.
6. Click “Propose changes”. GitHub will show you a page with a button “Create pull request” — click it.
7. Add a short title/description (why this improves the book) and click “Create pull request.”

The editor will consider your suggestions and may incorporate them in the text - you will get a notification when this happens.
