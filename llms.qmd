# Note on the LLMs

We are aware of the 800-pound _Gorilla gorilla gorilla_ in the room: we live in times where any basic programming task can be effectively (if not efficiently or exactly correctly) completed by a large language model. We refrain from the moral judgment on LLMs in our classes; it is a fact of life that students use LLM whether we like it or not, whether it is useful or not (see image below), or whether it is ethical to do so (see the [analysis of recent survey of ChatGPT users](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/seven-things-we-learned-from-openais-first-study-on-chatgpt-usage/)). 

However, in order to use LLMs effectively, students must understand what they are doing, which is not the case for the majority in the first few weeks of learning coding. Without understanding of why and how things work, students are unable to judge the LLM's output; even when they copy-paste the code and it works, they will not be able to solve a similar or related task next time.

This phenomenon - that LLMs are useful only if you already have a good idea what you need to do - is discussed well by prof. Ethan Mollick in his post [15 Times to use AI, and 5 Not to](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/15-times-to-use-ai-and-5-not-to). His final paragraph (emphasis mine):

> Knowing when to use AI turns out to be a form of wisdom, not just technical knowledge. _Like most wisdom, it's somewhat paradoxical: AI is often most useful where we're already expert enough to spot its mistakes, yet least helpful in the deep work that made us experts in the first place. It works best for tasks we could do ourselves but shouldn't waste time on, yet can actively harm our learning when we use it to skip necessary struggles._ 

We do not directly _teach_ the use of LLMs for coding, as we consider the purpose of the classes to be to acquire fundamental competencies in programmatic data analysis, which students must be able to do without code producers like LLMs. But the LLMs can be good _tutors_ for students learning to code on their own, and with that view in mind, we highly recommend the [AI TutoR textbook](https://psyteachr.github.io/AITutoR/), which guides learners to be more proficient users of LLMs, particularly in coding-related tasks.
