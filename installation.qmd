# Installation

Once R and R Studio are installed, go through the following steps to prepare them for work on the module. 

## Set up project structure for the module

**Warning!**

**Do not** put spaces in file or folder names. Use **-** or **\_** or **D**ifferent**C**ase to separate different parts of the name. For example: Research-Skills not Research Skills.

### **Step by step:**

**Step 1:** Open R Studio.

**Step 2:** Select **File → New project** located on the top left of the screen (if you are using a Mac put your mouse to the top and that will make the options appear) and then, in the window that appears, select **New directory**, then again select **New project**.

**Step 3:** In the form that appears, under "Directory name:", give your project directory a useful name (**SIB2001_2425**), and under "Create a project under subdirectory of:" select a convenient place on your computer to put it (strongly recommend OneDrive - University of Huddersfield) . Then click **Create Project**. R Studio will create your project folder and refresh the main window.

**Step 4:** In the R Studio bottom-right panel, click **New Folder** and create the first folder: "code". Repeat this step twice more to add folders: "data" and "output".

## Adjust the R Studio interface
